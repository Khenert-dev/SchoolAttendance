2. Directory Setup

Make sure your project folder looks like this. Do not move files outside this structure, or Flask may fail to locate templates and static files:

KCP-Attendance/
â”œâ”€ app.py # Main Flask application
â”œâ”€ attendance.db # SQLite database (created automatically)
â”œâ”€ attendance_backup.csv # Backup CSV file (generated automatically)
â”œâ”€ templates/ # HTML templates
â”‚ â”œâ”€ index.html
â”‚ â”œâ”€ register.html
â”‚ â”œâ”€ attendance.html
â”‚ â”œâ”€ records.html
â”‚ â”œâ”€ students.html
â”‚ â””â”€ import.html
â”œâ”€ static/ # CSS, JS, images
â”‚ â””â”€ style.css
â””â”€ README.md # Instructions file

Important: If you move files or folders, Flask may not find templates or static files, causing errors.
